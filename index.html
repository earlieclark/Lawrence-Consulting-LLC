      <h1>What We Do</h1>
      <hr>
      <p id="about-what">We aim to help companies transform themselves into smarter, sharper, and better versions of themselves. We take the two pronged approach in achieving this goal. First we help sharpen the image and perception of those who work for your organization. These people are the first line ambassadors of your brand and what you stand for, and secondly we help the company as a whole understand that  the perception and image of any company are at the core of its existence; these have taken years and in some cases decades to hone and perfect.</p>

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <hr>
      <p id="about-who">At Lawrence Consulting, we individualize those values and bridge the gap between generic advertising and marketing. Through social and community based programs, we help companies personalize their message and brand, while simultaneously giving back to the community and increasing their social awareness, responsibility and image currency. We understand each company is unique and different, and as such we customize our solutions to meet the individual needs and goals of each company, and help them achieve maximum results.</p>
